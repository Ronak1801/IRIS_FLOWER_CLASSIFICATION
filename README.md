# IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION

This is one of the most famous machine learning projects with Iris Flowers being the simplest
machine learning datasets in classification literature. 

The dataset has numeric attributes and
ML beginners need to figure out how to load and handle data. The iris dataset is small which
easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling, to
begin with.

The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ virginica,
setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.
